Java Mine Sweeper
==================

A basic implementation of the Mine Sweeper game using Java 8.

##Why?

Because I needed an excuse to program something in Java, and I had an old mine sweeper in Rust ready to be rewritten.

##How to play?

You will get the instructions printed in your console when you run the game.

##Hey! Something is wrong in your code!

Then you can open a pull request. I promise I will look at it! Any nitpicks about Java style are welcome as well.
